# whisper_mic_for_webui

run **python mic.py** 

run pip install -r requirements.txt (how to do with venv?)

and send what you say to webui to get a picture, mic is on listen constantly mode.

code is all from https://github.com/mallorbc/whisper_mic and https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui/discussions/3734

to do:
learn what venv does to get whisper working gpu, currently on cpu
see if openvino whisper version is viable
make text with single quotation work
do import value in apitest.py better
